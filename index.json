This tool captures the historical evolution of a text through various temporal stages, and interrelated data culled from various types of related texts. This tool also provides a historical view of the transmission of a text through the manuscript tradition. This tool provides an online interface which allows philologists to enter manuscript data for a text. It also provides an online interface which helps philologists compare the variants in a separate mode. It allows the user to generate phylogenetic trees, for the text, based on distance methods using the data entered in the tool. It also contains the facility to generate critical edition using a semi-supervised approach. This tool also divides the text into meaningful functional units and helps achieve a better comparison among the manuscripts. The text of the KV and its textual history is mentioned as a specific example to demostrate the features of this tool.","tags":["Artificial intelligence, Natural language processing, Information extraction, Indian languages"],"title":"An Introduction to the Textual History Tool","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Sravan Munukutla","Sayali Ghodekar","Pushpak Bhattacharyya","Malhar Kulkarni"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Cognate words are defined as word pairs across languages which exhibit partial or full lexical similarity and mean the same (e.g., hund-hound in German-English). In this paper, we use a Siamese Feed-forward neural network with word-embeddings to detect such word pairs. Our experiments with various embedding dimensions show larger embedding dimensions can only be used for large corpora sizes for this task. On a dataset built using linked Indian Wordnets, our approach beats the baseline approach with a significant margin (up to 71%) with the best F-score of 0.85% on the Hindi-Gujarati language pair.","tags":["Artificial intelligence, Natural language processing, Information extraction, Indian languages"],"title":"Keep Your Dimensions on a Leash: True Cognate Detection using Siamese Deep Neural Networks","type":"publication"}]
